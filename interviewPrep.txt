1. Employee Table
-- Id
-- Name
-- Salary
-- Department id
Find one employee from each department who is getting the highest salary within his department.

Discuss further on server side pagination, boundary cases like 2 emp getting the same salary in the same department which is highest etc

2.  
Flatten nested arrays in java.
1. Numbers or nested arrays can be upto n levels.
2. Recursive approach - Good to know

Code Template - https://onlinegdb.com/O1TZTwvHT
Ensure the candidate fork is given the detailed feedback
Ensure the candidate output is copy pasted into the detailed feedback

Example
Input -> [[[1],2],[3,4]]
Output -> [1,2,3,4]

3.
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,5,6]
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
 
Input: nums1 = [1], nums2 = []
Output: [1]
 
Input: nums1 = [0], nums2 = [1]
Output: [1]

This is a problem around OO design

Ask the candidate to start a new code snippet in onlingdb. Once the questions are done, make sure the code snippet is put in the feedback comments.

You have to design a solution (classes, interfaces, etc etc) for DeckofCards. Each card has a suit (heart, spade, club, diamond) and a rank (ace, king, queen jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2).

Problem 1
Write a function to Compare two cards and return bigger one. Suit doesnt matter.

Problem 2
You are given a shuffled deck of cards. You have to sort them (by suit and then by rank)

Reference - https://onlinegdb.com/4JEwMj2bU -- DO NOT share it with candidate.

Consider a class A with a synchronized method
class A {
public void synchronized m1() {Thread.sleep(5000);}
}
We create two objects of this class - o1 and o2. We call o1.m1() on one thread and o2.m1() on another thread, at the same time. What will be the behaviour?
Follow up with - how will you force these calls to execute one after the other
